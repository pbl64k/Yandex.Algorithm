2013 Yandex.Algorithm was an unmitigated disaster for me. While I qualified
for the prelims early and easily by virtue of taking part in the so-called
"test round", I knew I didn't do too well there. Actual qualification round
went even worse. While I did manage to solve a couple of problems, that was
a very poor performance compared to the rest of the field. Nonetheless, it
was round 1 that ended in a complete fiasco for me. I haven't managed to
solve any of the problems presented, and felt the time pressure was too much
for me. Between that and the following two rounds being scheduled to be more
convenient for participants in other TZs (you only needed to do well in one
round to qualify for the finals) I decided to bail out. Frankly, the whole
thing made me feel old, and it wasn't until ICFPC 2013 that I regained some
confidence in being sharp enough for this stuff.
